This report explains how a custom dictionary data structure and its associated functions were designed and implemented using the C programming language. The custom dictionary is designed to store key-value pairs and support various data types.



The CustomDict structure represents the dictionary data structure. It contains a dynamically resizable array to store key-value pairs.
The Item structure represents each key-value pair, containing the key, values, and other necessary information.
The Value union structure is used to store different data types, including integers (int), floating-point numbers (float or double), or characters (char).


create_dict(): Used to create an empty custom dictionary.
resize_dict(): Increases the capacity of the custom dictionary.
add_item(): Adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary.
delete_item(): Deletes a specified key-value pair.
set_value(): Modifies the value of an existing key.
search_item(): Searches for values associated with a specified key.
sort_dict(): Sorts the dictionary based on keys.
print_dict(): Prints the contents of the dictionary.
free_dict(): Frees the memory allocated for the custom dictionary.
read_csv(): Reads key-value pairs from a CSV file.


Each function is designed according to the requirements of the custom dictionary data structure.
Dynamic memory management (malloc, realloc, free) is used appropriately to prevent memory leaks.
Each function performs a specific task, with clear input parameters and return values.
Data types and return values clearly express the purpose of the functions.
Error handling is provided with appropriate return values in case of errors.
Conclusion and Recommendations:
This report has explained the design and implementation of a custom dictionary data structure and its functions. The usage of the data structure is ideal for storing key-value pairs and supporting various data types. For further improvement, performance enhancements or additional functions could be added to the code.
